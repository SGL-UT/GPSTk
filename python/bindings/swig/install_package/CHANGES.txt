v2.5, 2014-10-09 -- Initial release.


  Build changes:
  --------------

  - Addition of a single include file, gpstk_swig.hpp, to facilitate the
	SWIG wrapper code linking against the pre-compiled libgpstk.so library.
	  
  - Reorganization of some of the SWIG directives, such that the primary swig
    input file gpstk.i is intended to list only includes and ignores, whereas
	the secondary SWIG input files in src/files.i contain extension code, and
	other details.

  - Addition of a /cmake/Modules/FindGPSTk.cmake find module to enable
	the SWIG target in the CMake files to find the GPSTk library.

  Install changes:
  ----------------

  - Addition of __init__.py files for all package sub-directories.

  - Addition of a more conventional setup.py for distutils package install.
  
  - Addition of licensing information (COPYING.txt, COPYING.LESSER.txt)
  
  - Addition of install instructions (INSTALL.txt)
  
  - Addition of package contents list and starting points (README.txt)
  
  - Addition of hooks for alternative install options
    (MANIFEST.in, setup.py.in, setup.cfg)
  
  - Addition of this change-list (CHANGES.txt)

  Namespace changes:
  ------------------

  - Removal of sub-namespaces gpstk.cpp, gpstk.constants. gpstk.exceptions
	These did not represent the C++ namespace organization, nor were they
    in keeping with python module and package conventions.

  - Addition of sub-package gpstk.test, moving all unittest test cases into
    on location, while adding methods to facilitate calling all tests from 
	within the python interpreter, rather than only allowing them to be run
    as scripts.
	  
	    gpstk.test.run_all()
 
  - Addition of sub-package gpstk.data, moving all test data files into one
    location, and removing duplicates formerly included in both the test and
	example directories. Addition of package utilities to help find the full
	file paths to the data files after package install, for example:
	  
	    my_file = gpstk.data.full_path( 'rinex3nav_data.txt' )

  Script changes:
  ---------------
  
  - removal of example4.py as the C++ side no longer supports the particular
    ephemeris type conversion used in this example.
  - Modification of test scripts so that they now make up a sub-package and 
    can be imported from gpstk.test
