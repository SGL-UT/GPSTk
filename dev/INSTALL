Introduction
------------
   This project uses Jam for all of its configuration, build & install tasks.
   See http://perforce.com/jam/jam.html for more details on this tool.
   There are two sections below, excepted from the GPSTk website at 
   http://www.gpstk.org/, that describe how UNIX and Windows users
   can build and install the GPSTk.

   This project uses doxygen to dynamically generate API documentation.
   See http://www.doxygen.org/ for more details.

   As of ver. 1.1 we have introduced autoconf generated Makefiles into the 
   GPSTk. Since this is a new feature, your mileage may vary. If you don't
   know how use these makefile, the attached info at the bottom of this file
   from the Free Software Foundation will help.

   For more information about building the GPSTk, see the website at
   http://www.gpstk.org/


Building and Installing in a UNIX-like Environment using Jam
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - Linux, AIX and Windows/Cygwin using gcc versions 3.3 and 3.4
   - Solaris using Sun Workshop 6 or Sun ONE Studio 8

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as jam have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar

         $ tar xvzf gpstk.tar.gz

   4. Change into the gpstk directory and type

         $ jam

   5. To build the source documentation using doxygen:

         $ doxygen 

   6. To install GPSTk as a system library in /usr/local, assume root 
      privileges then execute

         $ jam install 


Building and Installing in a UNIX-like Environment using GNU make
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk using recent, 
standard GNU build tools. The build has been successfully tested using the 
following tools and versions:

   autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59
   GNU m4 1.4.2
   automake (GNU automake) 1.8.5

To check the version of the tool you are using, use the GNU standard version option. For example

   autoconf --version

If you successfully build the GPSTk using other versions of the tools, or 
if you successfully build in a new environment, please let us know.

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites, except jam , have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar

         tar xvzf gpstk.tar.gz

   4. Change into the gpstk directory and type

         ./autogen.sh
         ./configure
         make

   5. To build the source documentation using doxygen:
 
         doxygen 

   6. To install GPSTk as a system library in /usr/local, assume root 
      privileges then execute

         make install


Building under Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
------------------------------------------------

If you are building GPSTk under the Cygwin environment, then use the build
instructions for UNIX-like environments (above).

The GPSTk is not supported under Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, or earlier, mainly 
because templates in classes are not supported. Currently there are no 
Makefiles for MSVS, so you must use jam to build the GPSTk on the command line.

Here are the steps we have used to build under MSVS.NET 2003 and
the Free .NET Express Compiler 2005.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as jam have been installed.

   2. You may have to reinstall the compiler to build with GPSTk. In order f
      or Jam to work under Windows, the MSVS command line tools 
      (compiler and linker) must be installed in a directory without
      whitespace in it. Thus the default installation directory 
      (\Program Files\...), for example, will cause Jam to fail. Sorry, 
      you'll have to re-install in another directory. 
      Also, if the VSVARS32.BAT batch file was not installed, 
      this option must be chosen during a reinstallation.

   3. Open a command window and run the VSVARS32.BAT batch file before 
      running Jam. You should be able to type the following into the
      DOS Prompt:

      cl

      and get a response from the compiler.

   4. Jam requires that two other environment variables be set: MSCVNT,
      and MSCVER. The value you use depends on which version of the compiler
      you will used. For the 2003 .NET compiler use:

         set MSVCNT=C:\MSVS2003\VC7
         set MSCVER=1300

      For the 2005 Free Express Compiler use:

         set MSVCNT=C:\MSVS2005\VC
         set MSCVER=1400

      The directory on the right of the '=' is the directory where the command
      line tools are installed (it will have subdirectories bin,lib,include, 
      etc.); this tells Jam where the compiler and linker are. 

      Of course you may have other install directories; this example uses 
      C:\MSVC2003 for the 2003 tools and C:\MSVC2005 for the 2005 tools. Note 
      the different subdirectories '\VC7' and '\VC'; this is an MS thing, 
      these are the directories where the \bin, \lib, and \include directories
      are found. (The values 1300 and 1400 were chosen because all MS 
      compilers define the macro _MSC_VER as a float number of the form 
      'MMmm.mm' where MM is the major version, and mm.mm is the minor version 
      number; in MS VC++ versions 6, 7 and 8 the major versions are 12, 13, 
      and 14 respectively).

   5. Ensure the Jam executable for Windows is in the path. Install the GPSTk 
      tarball and change to the /dev directory of the GPSTk -- the file 
      'Jamrules' should be here -- and type

         jam

      Jam will tell you which compiler you are using, and then get to work.

Notes about the Windows build:

Note 1. You could install BOTH MS compilers, in different directories, and then put all this setup into batch files that allow you to run either one independently. For example:

      REM Batch file go2005.bat  Run from the command line
      REM    before using jam and the MS 2005 build tools.
      set MSVCNT=C:\MSVC2005\VC
      set MSCVER=1400
      REM This is a copy of VSVARS32.bat that came with MS VC++ 2005
      call VSVARS32_2005
      REM Move to my working directory
      cd C:\WorkingDirectory

and

      REM Batch file go2003.bat  Run from the command line
      REM    before using jam and the MS 2003 build tools.
      set MSVCNT=C:\MSVC2003\VC7
      set MSCVER=1300
      REM This is a copy of VSVARS32.bat that came with MS VC++.NET 2003
      call VSVARS32_2003
      REM Move to my working directory
      cd C:\WorkingDirectory

With  these batch  files the  whole process  is a  simple as  (a) open
command window, (b)  type go2005 (or go2003), (c)  type jam. Type 'jam
clean' to delete all the object (.obj) and executable (.exe) files.

Note 2. In the past we have required the command

set NEED_REGEX=yes

under   Windows,   in   order   to  ensure   that   src\regex.c   gets
compiled. However  this is  handled automatically within  the Jamrules
file and so it is not necessary to type this on the command line.

Note 3. The Jamrules file is where the MSCVER variable is required
(unlike the MSVCNT variable, which the jam executable requires). If
you use only one compiler exclusively, you might edit the Jamrules
file and remove this version dependency; then you would not need
MSCVER at all.

Note 4. In any  case you ought to look at the  Jamrules file; look for
$(NT),  which  the  Windows  executable  jam.exe  defines,  for  items
relevant to  Windows. C++FLAGS contains C++  compiler options, CCFLAGS
contains  C compiler  options (but  note  that CCFLAGS  is changed  in
\src\Jamfile for compiling regex.c), LINKFLAGS are linker options, and
LINKLIBS are extra libraries included in  the link.  # Note 5. We have
found  that optimization  is a  practical necessity  in  building with
these compilers. The option /O2 (that's capital 'oh' not 'zero') seems
to be  best for speed. Jamrules  now includes /O2 in  both versions of
the MS  compilers. Of course you  may change this, or  any compiler or
linker options, by editing Jamrules.

Note 6.  In the  past one  of the problems  in using  jam with  the MS
compilers beyond version 6.0  has been that the libraries advapi32.lib
and kernel32.lib seemed  to be missing. This, however,  comes from the
jam  executable,  not  from  MS.  These libraries  are  required,  and
provided,  in  MS VC++  6.0,  and  this is  the  default  for the  jam
executable.  Jam.exe does  this by  defining the  default  LINKLIBS to
include  these  libraries.  Since  they  are not  required  for  later
versions, Jamrules now redefines LINKLIBS  to be empty. If you want to
understand the defaults in jam.exe, go to the jam website and find the
Jambase file - it is a 'Jamrules' file that contains all the defaults.


ADDENDUM: Standard notes on using configure
-------------------------------------------

Foundation, Inc.

unlimited permission to copy, distribute and modify it.

Basic Installation
==================

   These are generic installation instructions.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a
file `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for
debugging `configure').

   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'
and enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves
the results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is
disabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale
cache files.)

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at
some point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you
may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create
`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need
`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using
a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'
for details on some of the pertinent environment variables.

   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters
by setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here
is an example:

     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix

   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a
time in the source code directory.  After you have installed the
package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring
for another architecture.

Installation Names
==================

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
package recognizes.

   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package
will run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the
_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the
`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:

     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

where SYSTEM can have one of these forms:

     OS KERNEL-OS

   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the machine type.

   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for.

   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a
platform different from the build platform, you should specify the
"host" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will
eventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Defining Variables
==================

   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the
environment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run
configure again during the build, and the customized values of these
variables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set
them in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:

     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc

will cause the specified gcc to be used as the C compiler (unless it is
overridden in the site shell script).

`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
