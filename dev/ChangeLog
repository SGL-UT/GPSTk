   - Deleted from src

       TabularEphemerisStore.cpp
         This class now obsoleted; functions reimplemented in new Ephemeris 
	 Store classes (SP3).

       ECEF.[h|c]pp
       Geodetic.[h|c]pp
	  Removed ECEF and Geodetic (which are deprecated), and 
	  modified code to use Position instead.

       EngEphemeris.cpp
	  Added modifications (Mendiola).

   - Added to lib

       /geomatics/AntennaStore.hpp
       /geomatics/KalmanFilter.hpp

       /geomatics/SpecialFunctions.hpp
       /geomatics/singleton.hpp
          Added new files to lib/geomatics from Rinex-3 branch.

       /procframe/ConstraintSystem.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/Variable.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'ConstraintSystem' class to RC2.0, as well as the appropriate
	  changes in 'Variable' class.

       /procframe/GeneralEquations.[h|c]pp
	  Added class 'GeneralEquations' to RC2.0.  The original 
	  version had very long inline methods, which are not recommended; 
	  therefore, a 'GeneralEquations.cpp' file was added.

       /procframe/Differentiator.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'Differentiator' class to RC2.0.

       /procframe/EquationSystem.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/GeneralConstraint.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/SolverGeneral.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'GeneralConstraint' class, as well as additions to related 
	  classes.

       /rxio/EphReader.cpp
       /rxio/FFIdentifier.cpp
       /rxio/MDPPVTSolution.hpp
	  Modified library to reflect more meaningful constants' names in 
	  XvtStore.

       /procframe/DataHeaders.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/DataStructures.[h|c]pp
	  Changed to CommonTime.

       /procframe/ProcessingClass.hpp
          The 'getIndex()' method and its associated operators were deleted 
	  from 'ProcessingClass'. This feature made developing more complex, 
	  it potentially limited the compilation on parallel machines, and 
	  it seems that no one was using it.

       ObsID.cpp
          Fixed an incorrect comment.

       FICData.[h|c]pp
          Added a method to describe each field for each block. Also fixed
          navdmp so that date filtering works. Data are filtered based upon the
          transmission rather than the epoch date; related to SourceForge
          Bug #1196179.

       FICData.cpp
          Fixed bug in display of almanac time. Also modified appearance of
          SF4, SF5 data.

       FICFilterOperators.hpp
          Modified appearance of SF4, SF5 data. Also fixed navdmp so that date
          filtering works. Data are filtered based upon the transmission rather
          than the epoch date; related to SourceForge Bug #1196179. Also fixed

	  which block to convert in the RINEX file (if blank, default=9).

       Position.cpp
          Fixed bug related to converting between Geocentric and Geodetic
          systems. Longitude was always set to 0 in both cases.
          SourceForge Bug ID #1499586. Also fixed bug related to converting a
          position string with leading spaces to a Position.  SourceForge Bug
          ID #1530502.

       StringUtils.hpp
          Fixed namespace issue: strtod, strtoul, strtol declared in cstdlib
          but this was not included in StringUtils causing an error on some
          platforms. Also fixed formatting issue. Also modified to eliminate
          definition conflict with Windows "max" function.

       TypeID.[h|c]pp
          New types added to handle common derivatives. Also added derivatives
          for phase observations and some combinations; added corresponding
          TypeID's for the GRoup And PHase Ionospheric Combinations (GRAPHIC).
          Also new TypeIDs added w/ability to manage new TypeIDs w/string name.
          Added extra qualification on member class and std space for 'pair'
          to fix compilation errors. Also added a new TypeID 'codeBias' used to
          estimate slant TEC and separate interfrequency bias. Also added new
          "wide lane" TypeIDs for use in fast ambiguity resolution, as well as 
          'WL2' and related combinations. TypeIDs added to support 'spaceborne'
          data processing. TypeIDs added for GPS precise code observation 
          derivative.

          Added method to compute the acceleration of the indicated object in 
          ECEF coordinates. Also private class members changed to protected to
          allow inheritance.

       BinUtils.[h|c]pp
          Added the CRC for GPS CNAV.

       MatrixFunctors.hpp
          Made changes so that PRSolve turns on flags to reject bad SP3 data;
          Improved Householder algorithm.

       RinexsObsData.[h|c]pp
       RinexObsFilterOperators.hpp

       EngAlmanac.[h|c]pp
          Added EngAlmanac::getSVConfig() to enable access to SV configuration.
          Implemented missing definition for EngAlmanac::get6bitHealth().

       PRSolution.cpp
          Fixed RAIM algorithm to continue when it fails to converge if there's
          still room to do combinations (i.e., still possible to reject
          satellites). Also modified to save the covariance matrix
          corresponding to the best solution.

       SVNumXRef.cpp
          Updated class for launch of SVN50/PRN05 on 8/17/09. Also updated for

          surface plots of its solutions. Paper is in the works. Also, mpsolve
          user can edit out days when processing large directories of data.
          Also added zero mean assumption to add final de-bias/constraint on
          DFM processing. Disabled position solution consistency check. Also in
          mpsolve fixed two bugs: one for the DFM method when no intersections 
          were found, one for the DFM method when a pass exists that is less
          than two points.

Version 1.4   Tuesday, December 18, 2007

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Majority of version 1.4 comprised of revision number 863 
	  branching took place under revision 864 from dev/ to RC1.4/
	
	- Major refactoring of the Ephemeris/Almanac classes. This change may 
	  break some apps. To fix them the following translations are useful:
	
              Old                           |        New
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gpstk::EphemerisStore		    | gpstk::XvtStore<gpstk::SatID>
    gpstk::BCEphemerisStore		    | gpstk::GPSEphemerisStore
    gpstk::AlmanacStore                     | gpstk::GPSAlmanacStore
    gpstk::EphemerisStore::NoEphemerisFound | gpstk::InvalidRequest
    eph.getSatXvt(sat, time)	            | eph.getXvt(sat, time)
    eph.getSatXvt(prn, time)		    | eph.getXvt(SatID(prn, SatID::systemGPS), time)
    eph.dump(0, cout)			    | eph.dump(cout, 0)


        - Added an updated LaTeX source for table describing apps of v1.3, 
	        as well as a list of classes in the gpstk libraries 
	        (sorted & categorized) found in ref/glance/

	- Added LeTex source for the GPSTk paper at the ION-GNSS-2006

	- Added a library /dev/lib/vplot/ to create drawing primitives in SVG 
	        and postscript formats. Intended to support complex, fully 
	        customizable visualizations on GNSS analyses. Supported only 
	        in jam for now,	but with the hope of support in make.

	- Improved version control 
	  * set gpstk package version to 1.3 in the autoconf build world
	  * set the current shared library major version to 13, so gpstk 1.3
	    delivers lib{gpstk,rxio,mdplib,...}.so.13.0
	  * now allows jam and make to build shared libraries with the 
	    appropriate versions
	  * causes jam to install headers to $PREFIX/include/gpstk to prevent 
	    header namespace collision. This behaviour is consistent with the 
	    "make" build.

	- Moved apps/geomatics/lib library to dev/lib/geomatics

Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
	- Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
	  any confusion that might develop over having the same method
	  name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

	- Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications
	-------------------------
	
	apps/difftools

	- Unified code using a common class.


	apps/filetools

	- Improvments to navdmp.

	- New utility called rinexthin for subsampling RINEX observation
	  files.

	
	apps/binding
	
	- This  new project provides GPSTk bindings in other languages
	  has been added. This capability is in an alpha state.
	  Currently there are a limited set of bindings for
	  Tcl/Tk, Python and Octave.
