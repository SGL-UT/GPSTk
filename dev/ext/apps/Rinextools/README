Rinex tools (/apps/Rinextools)

   This directory contains 4 standalone programs which are useful in
manipulating Rinex version 2 or 3 observation files. Each program has a 'syntax page' that gives instructions on how to run it; see the syntax page by running without arguments or with --help.

They apps are:
   RinDump     dumps Rinex observation data in columns in a flat file, useful
               for plotting; also computes and dumps standard linear combinations
               of data, for example ionosphere-free phase or Melbourne-Wubbena combo.
   RinSum      summarizes a Rinex observation file
   RinEdit     reads and edits a Rinex observation file, writing out the a
               new, edited one.
   RinNav      reads any number of Rinex (ver 2 or 3) navigation files and prints a
               summary on the screen; also, if an output file or files are specified,
               writes a unique superset of all the ephemeris data to that file(s).
               It will also correct the time on the epoch line if it is inconsistent
               with the week number in the ephemeris.

Comments appreciated; submit them to the wiki. Enjoy!
