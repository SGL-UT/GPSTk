"""
A GPSTk example featuring the use of RINEX processing and using the PRSolution2 class.

This is a port of the older C++ example4.cpp.

Usage:
  python example4.py <RINEX3 Obs file> <RINEX3 Nav file> [-m <RINEX Met file>]'

For example:
  python example4.py rinex3obs_data.txt rinex3nav_data.txt -m rinexmet_data.txt
