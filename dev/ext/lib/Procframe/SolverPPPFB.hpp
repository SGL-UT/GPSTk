      /** This class computes the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solution
       *  using a Kalman solver that combines ionosphere-free code and phase
       *  measurements. Also, this class uses the 'forwards-backwards'
       *  approach, where the provided data set is processed from 'past to
       *  future' and from 'future to past' several times.
       *
       * This approach improves the final solution because it takes advantage
       * of a better phase ambiguity resolution. On the other hand, it is only
       * applicable in post-process mode (of course).
       *
       * In reality, "SolverPPPFB.hpp" objects are really "SolverPPP.hpp"
       * objects at their core, with some wrapper code that takes 'normal'
       * forwards input data, stores them, and feeds the internal "SolverPPP"
       * object with a continuous data stream formed by several instances of
       * forwards input data, "mirrored" input data (oldest is newest and
       * viceversa), forwards input data again, and so on.
       *
       * In order to achieve this, SolverPPPFB.hpp" objects work in three
       * distinct phases:
       *
       *    \li Initial "Process()" phase: This does a "normal" forward
       *        processing, like the "SolverPPP.hpp" objects. Data feed during
       *        this phase are internally stored for later phases.
       *    \li "ReProcess()" phase: In this phase the filter will process the
       *        stored data in "backwards-forwards" fashion as many times as
       *        set by the provided "cycles" parameter (by default, "cycles" is
       *        equal to 1). This phase always ends in backwards processing.
       *    \li "LastProcess()" phase: This is the last phase and it is always
       *        done in forwards mode. During this phase you will get your
       *        final results.
       *
       * Take due note that the "SolverPPPFB.hpp" class is designed to be used
       * ONLY with GNSS data structure objects from "DataStructures" class.
       *
       * A typical way to use this class follows:
       *
       * @code
       *      // INITIALIZATION PART
       *
       *      // EBRE station nominal position
       *   Position nominalPos(4833520.192, 41537.1043, 4147461.560);
       *   RinexObsStream rin("ebre0300.02o");  // Data stream
       *
       *      // Load all the SP3 ephemerides files
       *   SP3EphemerisStore SP3EphList;
       *   SP3EphList.loadFile("igs11512.sp3");
       *   SP3EphList.loadFile("igs11513.sp3");
       *   SP3EphList.loadFile("igs11514.sp3");
       *
       *   NeillTropModel neillTM( nominalPos.getAltitude(),
       *                           nominalPos.getGeodeticLatitude(),
       *                           30 );

       *      cout << pppSolver.getSolution(TypeID::wetMap) << "  "; // Tropo-#5
       *
       *   }
       * @endcode
       *
       * The "SolverPPPFB" object will also insert back postfit residual data
       * (both code and phase) into "gRin" if it successfully solves the
       * equation system.
       *
       * By default, it will build the geometry matrix from the values of
       * coefficients wetMap, dx, dy, dz and cdt, IN THAT ORDER. Please note
       * that the first field of the solution will be the estimation of the
       * zenital wet tropospheric component (or at least, the part that wasn't
       * modeled by the tropospheric model used).
       *
       * You may configure the solver to work with a NEU system in the class
       * constructor or using the "setNEU()" method.
       *
       * In any case, the "SolverPPPFB" object will also automatically add and
       * estimate the ionosphere-free phase ambiguities. The independent vector
       * is composed of the code and phase prefit residuals.
       *
       * This class expects some weights assigned to each satellite. That can
       * be achieved with objects from classes such as "ComputeIURAWeights",
       * "ComputeMOPSWeights", etc.
       *
       * If these weights are not assigned, then the "SolverPPPFB" object will
       * set a value of "1.0" to code measurements, and "weightFactor" to phase
       * measurements. The default value of "weightFactor" is "10000.0". This
       * implies that code sigma is 1 m, and phase sigma is 1 cm.
       *
       * By default, the stochastic models used for each type of variable are:
       *
       *    \li Coordinates are modeled as constants (StochasticModel).
       *    \li Zenital wet tropospheric component is modeled as a random walk
       *        (RandomWalkModel), with a qPrime value of 3e-8 m*m/s.
       *    \li Receiver clock is modeled as white noise (WhiteNoiseModel).
       *    \li Phase biases are modeled as white noise when cycle slips
       *        happen, and as constants between cycle slips
       *        (PhaseAmbiguityModel).
       *
       * You may change this assignment with methods "setCoordinatesModel()",
       * "setTroposphereModel()" and "setReceiverClockModel()". However, you
       * are not allowed to change the phase biases stochastic model.
       *
       * Given the nature of this solver, it is possible for it to trim data
       * according to some preset postfit residuals limits, deleting out
       * potential outliers.
       *
       * The former is achieved by setting a couple lists of limits (one for
       * code postfit residuals and the other for phase ones) that will be
       * applied, one forward-backward cycle for each, in the same order they
       * where added. One code limit and one phase limit are applied
       * simultaneously per cycle.
       *
       * In this case you must call the "ReProcess(void)" method instead of the
       * "ReProcess(int)" method.
       *
       * A way to apply this feature follows:
       *
       * @code
       *      // INITIALIZATION PART
       *
       *      // INITIALIZATION CODE HERE...
       *
       *      // Declare a SolverPPPFB object
       *   SolverPPPFB pppSolver;
       *
       *      // Add limits to solver. Let's start with pseudorange limits
       *   pppSolver.addCodeLimit(10.0);     // 10 m
       *   pppSolver.addCodeLimit(5.0);      //  5 m
       *   pppSolver.addCodeLimit(2.0);      //  2 m
       *
       *      // Now, let's follow with phase limits
       *   pppSolver.addPhaseLimit(0.10);    // 10 cm
       *   pppSolver.addPhaseLimit(0.05);    //  5 cm
       *   pppSolver.addPhaseLimit(0.02);    //  2 cm
       *
       *      // PROCESSING PART CODE HERE...
       *
       *
       *      // --->>> ReProcess() phase <<<--- //
       *
       *   try
       *   {
       *
       *         // Now, let's do the forward-backward cycles.
       *         // Please note that this method needs no parameters.
       *         // Three forwards-backwards cycles will be made because
       *         // maximum limits list size is 3.
       *      pppSolver.ReProcess();
       *
       *   }
       *   catch(Exception& e)
       *   {
       *      cerr << "Exception: " << e << endl;
