/// class SRI encapsulates all the information associated with the solution of a set
/// of simultaneous linear equations. It is used in least squares estimation (linear
/// and linearized) and is the basis of the preferred implementation of Kalman
/// filtering. An SRI consists of just three things:
/// (1) 'R', the 'information matrix', which is an upper triangular matrix of
/// dimension N, equal to the inverse of the square root (or Cholesky decomposition)
/// of the solution covariance matrix,
/// (2) 'Z', the 'SRI state vector' of length N (parallels the components of R),
/// (not to be confused with the regular state vector X), and
/// (3) 'names', a Namelist used to label the elements of R and Z (parallels and
/// labels rows and columns of R and elements of Z). A Namelist is part of class SRI
/// because the manipulations of SRI (see functions below) requires a consistent way
/// of manipulating the different individual elements of R and Z, in addition it
/// allows the user to attach 'human-readable' labels to the elements of the state
/// vector, which is useful in adding, dropping and bumping states, and it makes
/// printed results more readable (see the LabelledMatrix class in Namelist.hpp).
///
/// The set of simultaneous equations represented by an SRI is R * X = Z, where X is
/// the (unknown) state vector (the conventional solution vector) also of dimension N.
/// The state X is solved for as X = inverse(R) * Z, and the covariance matrix of the
/// state X is equal to transpose(inverse(R))*inverse(R).
///
/// Least squares estimation via SRI is very simple and efficient; it uses the
/// Householder transformation to convert the problem to upper triangular form, and
/// then uses very efficient algorithms to invert the information matrix to find the
/// solution and its covariance. The usual matrix equation is H * X = D,
/// where H is the 'design matrix' or the 'partials matrix', of dimension M x N,
/// X is the (unknown) solution vector of length N, and D is the 'data' or
/// 'measurement' vector of length M. In the least squares 'update' of the SRI,
/// this set of information {H,D} is concatenated with the existing SRI {R,Z} to
/// form an (N+M x N+1) matrix Q which has R in the upper left, Z upper right,
/// H lower left and D lower right. This extended matrix is then subjected to a
/// Householder transformation (see class Matrix), which will put (at least the
/// first N columns of) Q into upper triangular form. The result is a new, updated
/// SRI (R and Z) in the place of the old, while in place of D are residuals of fit
/// corresponding to the measurements in D (the H part of Q is trashed). This result,
/// in fact (see the reference), produces an updated SRI which gives precisely the
/// usual least squares solution for the combined 'a priori SRI + new data' problem.
/// This algorithm is called a 'measurement update' of the SRI.
///
/// It is most enlightening to think of the SRI and this process in terms of
/// 'information'. The SRI contains all the 'information' which has come from
/// updates that have been made to it using (H,D) pairs. Initially, the SRI is all
/// zeros, which corresponds to 'no information'. This overcomes one serious problem
/// with conventional least squares and the Kalman algorithm, namely that a
/// 'zero information' starting value cannot be correctly expressed, because in that
/// case the covariance matrix is singular and the state vector is indeterminate;
/// in the SRI method this is perfectly consistent - the covariance matrix is
/// singular because the information matrix (R) is zero, and thus the state
/// is entirely indeterminate. As new 'information' (in the form of data D and
/// partials matrix H pairs) is added to the SRI (via the Householder algorithm),
/// the 'information' stored in R and Z is increased and they become non-zero.
/// (By the way note that the number of rows in the {H,D} information is arbitrary -
/// information can be added in 'batches' - M large - or one - M=1 - piece at a time.)
/// When there is enough information, R becomes non-singular, and so can be inverted
/// and the solution and covariance can be computed. As the amount of information
/// becomes large, elements of R become large, and thus elements of the covariance
/// (think of covariance as a measure of uncertainty - the opposite or inverse of
/// information) become small.
///
/// The structure of the SRI method allows some powerful techniques to be used in 
/// manipulating, combining and separating state elements and the information
/// associated with them in SRIs. For example, if the measurement updates have
/// failed to increase the information about one particular state element, then
/// that element, and its information, may be removed from the problem by deleting
/// that element's row and column of R, and its element of Z (and then
/// re-triangularizing the SRI). In general, any subset of an SRI may be separated,
/// or the SRI split (see the routine of that name below - note the caveats) into
/// two separate SRIs. For another example, SRI allows the information of a each
/// state element to be selectively reduced or even zeroed, simply by multiplying
/// the corresponding elements of R and Z by a factor; in Kalman filtering this
/// is called a 'Q bump' of the element and is very important in some filtering
/// applications. There are methods (see below) consistently to merge (operator+()),
/// split, and permute elements of, SRIs.
///
/// Kalman filtering is an important application of SRI methods (actually it is
/// called 'square root information filtering' or SRIF - technically the term
/// 'Kalman filter algorithm' is reserved for the classical algorithm just as
/// Kalman presented it, in terms of a state vector and its covariance matrix).
/// The measurment update described above (which is actually just linear least
/// squares) is half of the SRIF (Kalman filter) - there is a 'time update' that
/// propagates the SRI (and thus the state and covariance) forward in time using
/// the dynamical model of the filter. These are algebraically equivalent to the
/// classical Kalman algorithm, but are more efficient and numerically stable
/// (actually the Kalman algorithm has been shown to be numerically unstable!).
/// There are even SRI smoothing algorithms, corresponding to Kalman smoothers,
/// which consist of a 'backwards' filter, implemented by applying a
/// 'smoother update' to the SRI at each point in reverse order.
