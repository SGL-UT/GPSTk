/** class SRIFilter inherits SRI and implements a square root information filter,
 * which is the square root formulation of the Kalman filter algorithm. SRIFilter may
 * be used for Kalman filtering, smoothing, or for simple least squares, including
 * weighted, linear or linearized, robust and/or sequential algorithms.
 *
 * At any point the state X and covariance P are related to the SRI by
 * X = inverse(R) * z , P = inverse(R) * inverse(transpose(R)), or
 * R = upper triangular square root (Cholesky decomposition) of the inverse of P,
 * and z = R * X.
 *
 * The SRIFilter implements Kalman filter algorithm, which includes sequential least
 * squares (measurement update), dynamic propagation (time update), and smoothing
 * (technically the term 'Kalman filter algorithm' is reserved for the classical
 * algorithm just as Kalman presented it, in terms of a state vector and its
 * covariance matrix).
 *
 * The SRIFilter measurment update (which is actually just linear least squares) is
 * half of the SRIFilter (Kalman filter) - there is a 'time update' that propagates
 * the SRI (and thus the state and covariance) forward in time using the dynamical
 * model of the filter. These are algebraically equivalent to the classical Kalman
 * algorithm, but are more efficient and numerically stable (actually the Kalman
 * algorithm has been shown to be numerically unstable!). The SRIFilter smoothing
 * algorithms consists of a 'backwards' filter, implemented by applying a
 * 'smoother update' to the SRIFilter at each point in reverse order.
