/**
 * @file SolidEarthTides.hpp
 * Implement the formula for the displacement of a point fixed to the solid Earth
 * due to the solid Earth tides resulting from the influence of the Sun and Moon.
 * Reference IERS Conventions (1996) found in IERS Technical Note 21 (IERS).
 * NB. Currently only the largest terms are implemented, yielding a result accurate
 * to the millimeter level. Specifically, IERS pg 61 eq 8 and IERS pg 65 eq 17.
 * The second equation referenced here is the permanent component.
 * Class SolarSystem is used to get Solar and Lunar ephemeris information, as well
 * as GM for sun and moon.
