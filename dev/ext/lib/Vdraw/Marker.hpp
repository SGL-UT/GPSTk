   * This class defines a marker which will be drawn at every point on a
   * line.
   *
   * The user-creatable BasicShape entry was removed as it presents 
   * more difficulties than it is worth in each language.  In postscript
   * a duplicate of every draw method for a basicshape class would have
   * to be made using only relative drawing and spacing and such might
   * have to be addressed.  In svg, markers seem to need to be in the 
   * first quadrant (i.e. not centered on 0 0) and their middle has to
   * be defined there as well (think of it as a translation from (0,0)
   * to somewhere where the mark fits in the first quadrant) as my 
   * tests seemed to show tha svg (at the time at least) would cut off
   * everything out of its bounds (quadrants II, III, IV).  Also there are
   * issues with the bounds of the marker and such.
