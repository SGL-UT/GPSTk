   * construction and use of this dataset.

   * It is suggested that the users of this class, call a constructor with an
   * estimated size for the vector, as only one allocation will occur
   * (hopefully) and this should signifigantly speed up things.  This number
   * can be overestimated (at the cost of space if not all of it is used. unless
   * followed by a call to tighten()) or underestimated (which will ensure that 
   * space isn't wasted but at a cost of time for reallocation if points are 
   * added over the estimate).
