   * I probably need a class for the following things:
   *
   * - Axis setup
   *   - This would be in the middle (on 0) or on an edge as a border
   *     of the plot/frame.
   *   * StrokeStyle for everything
   *   * Length of ticks 
   *   * Alignment of ticks
   *     -  --|   Left
   *     -   -|-  Center
   *     -    |-- Right
   *     -   |     |  
   *     -  ---   ---   --- 
   *     -         |     |
   *     - Above Center Below
   *   - Placement of ticks
   *     - Evenly space n across the line (to bounds)
   *     - or evenly space them a given amount to wherever
   *     - Start at 0 or side
   *   - Tick recursion for najor/minor ticks
   *   - Tick recursion for labels
   *   - Label placement
   *   - Label formatting?
   *   * TextStyle for label
   *   - Direction for axis
   *   - Bounds!
   *     - Bound generation from min/max (with buffer area? round?)
   * - If this is a seperate class it needs a set of COPY commands
   *   that copy to a different orientation.  Or a mirror setting that
   *   does so automagically.
