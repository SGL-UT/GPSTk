This is a 'NEW' library for GPSTK.

It will be designed to be a library of components to help users develop application programs to solve problems in astrodynamics like spacecraft navigation
and precise orbit determination.

Planned Features:

  1 Astrodynamics constants

  2 Time and coordinate transformations with desirable precision.

  3 Obit element conversions

  4 ODE solvers(RKF78)

  5 Force models for spaceborne orbiters

  6 Accurate orbit progagation

  7 Orbit fitting with batch and fitering processing strategy

  8 And more assist classes for spaceborne data processing(some classes work with GDS will be add to procframe).

 
I'll polish the codes and upload it day by day.
