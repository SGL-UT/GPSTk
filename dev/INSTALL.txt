More background information and detailed instuctions can be 
found at the GPSTk website, http://www.gpstk.org/.  The website
contains the latest information, support forum, and email and IRC
contacts to obtain help on the project.  Please utilize these
resource for problems with or questions about the GPSTk.

Introduction
------------
   This project uses CMake for all of its configuration, build & install tasks.
   See http://www.cmake.org/ for more details on this tool.
   There are multiple sections below, excepted from the GPSTk website at 
   http://www.gpstk.org/, that describe how UNIX,OS X and Windows users
   can build and install the GPSTk.  (Please refer to the GPSTk website
   for the most detailed and up to date information.)

   This project uses doxygen to dynamically generate API documentation.
   See http://www.doxygen.org/ for more details.

   For more information about building the GPSTk, see the website at
   http://www.gpstk.org/

Building and Installing in a UNIX-like Environment using the GPSTk script
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - Linux, Solaris, Mac OSx

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar

         $ tar xvzf gpstk.tar.gz

   4. Navigate to the root GPSTk directory

   5. Run the GPSTk script with the desired parameters

      Build and Installation using default paths

         $ ./script_gpstk.sh

      Add optional parameters for additional functionality

         $ ./script_gpstk.sh [-h] [-cpdbiotv] [-l <path>] [-r <path>] [-s <path>]

         -h     help             Show this message

         -c     build_cpp        build C++ files and libraries
         -d     build_doxygen    build Doxygen files (used for python docstrings)
         -p     build_python     build Python files and libraries with SWIG bindings
         -e     build_sphinx     build Sphinx RST files into HTML documentation

         -b     clean_build      rm -rf gpstk_root/build; rm -rf python_root/build
         -i     clean_install    rm -rf gpstk_install; rm -rf python_install
         
         -o     core_only        only builds core library code
         -t     test_switch      initialize test framework
         -v     graphviz         generate dependency graph (.DOT and .PDF files)

         -r     gpstk_root       default = $gpstk_root, path to GPSTk dev top-level CMakeLists.txt file (and source tree)
         -s     gpstk_install    default = $gpstk_install,  GPSTk install path prefix, to contain ./bin, ./lib, and ./include.
                                 If a relative path is supplied here, it needs to be relative to gpstk_root
         -l     python_install   default = $python_install, Python bindings package install path prefix


Building and Installing in a UNIX-like Environment using CMake
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - Linux & Solaris

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar

         $ tar xvzf gpstk.tar.gz

   4. Create a directory for your build. For example, change into the gpstk/ directory and type

         $ mkdir build

   5. Change into the gpstk/build directory, this will be where all of the build files will reside.

   6. If GPSTk will be installed as a system library in /usr/local, execute the following commands:

         $ cmake ../ or ../dev (if using Developer repo)

         $ make

      To install to a different directory, the install directory must be set-up when CMake configures the makefiles. Execute the following commands:

         $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install ../ or ../dev (if using Developer repo)

         $ make

   7. To install GPSTk, executee

         $ make install 
  
   8. To build the source documentation using doxygen: Change into the gpstk/dev directory (if using Developer repo) or the gpstk/ directory (if using the tarball), and type

         $ doxygen 


Building and Installing in OSX using CMake - Terminal
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - OS X Developer Tools under Mavericks (10.9.5)

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that OS X Developer Tools and CMake have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar

         $ tar xvzf gpstk.tar.gz

   4. Create a directory for your build. For example, change into the gpstk/ directory and type

         $ mkdir build

   5. Change into the gpstk/build directory, this will be where all of the build files will reside.

   6. If GPSTk will be installed as a system library in /usr/local, execute the following commands:

         $ cmake ../ or ../dev (if using Developer repo)

         $ make

      To install to a different directory, the install directory must be set-up when CMake configures the makefiles. Execute the following commands:

         $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/path/to/install ../ or ../dev (if using Developer repo)

         $ make

   7. To install GPSTk, executee

         $ make install 
  
   8. To build the source documentation using doxygen: Change into the gpstk/dev directory (if using Developer repo) or the gpstk/ directory (if using the tarball), and type

         $ doxygen
