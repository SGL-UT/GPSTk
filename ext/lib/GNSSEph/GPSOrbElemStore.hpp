       *  Notes regarding the rationalize( ) function.
       *  The timing relationships defined in IS-GPS-200 20.3.4.5 mean
       *  (1.) The end of validity of a given set of orbital elements
       *  may be determined by the beginning of transmission of a new
       *  upload.   
       *  (2.) The beginning of validity of the SECOND set of elements
       *  following and upload should be Toe-(0.5 fit interval) but
       *  it is not practical to differentiate between the first and

       *  second set following an upload when only looking at a 
       *  single set of elements.
       *
       *  The rationalize( ) function is a means of addressing these 
       *  shortcomings.   The intention is to load all the navigation
       *  message data in the store, then call rationalize( ).  The
       *  function will sweep through the ordered set of elements and
       *  make appropriate adjustments to beginning and end of 
       *  validity values.  In general, the only changes will
       *  occur in set of elements immediately before an upload,
       *  the first set following the upload, and (perhaps) the
       *  second set following the upload.
