Introduction
------------

The most up-to-date project information can be found at the project website, 
including build and install instructions, the latest project news, a support 
forum, IRC, and contact information:

    http://www.gpstk.org/

The easiest way to build an install GPSTk is to use the shell script provided 
with the source distribution. See below for more details on use of the script, 
details on building on POSIX platforms, and where to get instructions for 
building with CMake, both with Xcode on OSX and Visual Studio on Windows.


Dependencies
------------

This project uses CMake for all of its configuration, build & install tasks.
   
    http://www.cmake.org/

This project uses SWIG for generation of python bindings for the C++ library.
   
    http://www.swig.org/

This project (optionally) uses doxygen to dynamically generate API documentation.
   
    http://www.doxygen.org/

This project (optionally) uses Sphinx for some documentation generation
   
    http://sphinx-doc.org/


UNIX-like Environment: Preparation
----------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments:

   - Linux, OSX, Solaris

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake and swig have been installed.

   2. Obtain the GPSTk source distribution.

   3. If needed, extract the GPSTk compressed archive.
      For example, using GNU tar and gunzip:

         $ tar -xvzf gpstk.tgz

   4. Navigate to the root directory of the extract GPSTk file tree, herein
      called $gpstk_root:

         $ cd $gpstk_root


UNIX-like Environment: Automated Build and Install
--------------------------------------------------

If you prefer automation, run the GPSTk script. See the script help for details 
on those parameters:

    $ cd $gpstk_root

    $ ./build.sh -h

Typical user installs will look like this:

    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/gpstk/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

    $ ./build.sh -edu

Typical system installs will look like this:

    $ ./build.sh -ed


UNIX-like Environment: Manual Build and Install
-----------------------------------------------

If you instead prefer or need to run commands one at a time, run the following 
commands instead of build.sh:

   1. If you want documentation of the C++ classes and improved python 
      docstrings:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/doc

         $ doxygen 

   2. Create a directory for your build:

         $ cd $gpstk_root

         $ mkdir $gpstk_root/build

   3. Change into the $gpstk_root/build directory, this will be where all of the
      build files will reside.

   4. If you prefer to build and install GPSTk as a system library in /usr/local, 
      execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/build

         $ cmake $gpstk_root

         $ make

         $ make install 

   5. If you prefer to build and install GPSTk as a user library in $HOME/.local, 
      skip the previous step, and instead execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/build

         $ cmake -DPYTHON_USER_INSTALL=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/gpstk $gpstk_root

         $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/gpstk/lib:LD_LIBRARY_PATH

         $ make

         $ make install 

         $ export PATH=$HOME/.local/gpstk/bin:$PATH
