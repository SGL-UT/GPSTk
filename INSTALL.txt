Introduction
------------
   This project uses CMake for all of its configuration, build & install tasks.
   See http://www.cmake.org/ for more details on this tool.
   There are multiple sections below, excepted from the GPSTk website at 
   http://www.gpstk.org/, that describe how UNIX,OS X and Windows users
   can build and install the GPSTk.  (Please refer to the GPSTk website
   for the most detailed and up to date information.)

   This project uses doxygen to dynamically generate API documentation.
   See http://www.doxygen.org/ for more details.

   For more information about building the GPSTk, see the website at
   http://www.gpstk.org/

Building and Installing in a UNIX-like Environment using the GPSTk script
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - Linux, Solaris, Mac OSx

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake have been installed.

   2. Clone the GPSTk repository or otherwise obtain or download the GPSTk distributio from http://www.gpstk.org

   3. If needed, extract the GPSTk tarball. For example, using GNU tar and gunzip:

         $ tar -xvzf gpstk.tgz

   4. Navigate to the root GPSTk directory, henceforth called $gpstk_root

         $ cd $gpstk_root

   5. Run the GPSTk script with the desired parameters. See the script help for details on those parameters:

         $ ./build.sh -h


Building and Installing in a Unix-like Environment using CMake
------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes build and installation under the following environments.

   - Linux, OSX, Solaris

The following procedure will build and install the GPSTk.

   1. Ensure that prerequisites such as cmake have been installed.

   2. Download the GPSTk distribution.

   3. Extract the GPSTk compressed archive. For example, using GNU tar

         $ tar -xvzf gpstk.tgz

   4. Navigate to the root GPSTk directory, henceforth called $gpstk_root

   4. Create a directory for your build.

         $ cd $gpstk_root

         $ mkdir $gpstk_root/build

   5. Change into the $gpstk_root/build directory, this will be where all of the build files will reside.

   6. To build and install GPSTk as a system library in /usr/local, execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/build

         $ cmake $gpstk_root

         $ make

         $ make install 

      To build and install GPSTk as a user library in $HOME/.local, execute the following commands:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/build

         $ cmake -DPYTHON_USER_INSTALL=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.local/gpstk $gpstk_root

         $ make

         $ make install 
  
   7. To build the source documentation using doxygen:

         $ cd $gpstk_root/doc

         $ doxygen
