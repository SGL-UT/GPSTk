      Adding EngAlmanac Test     - Uses classes from AlmanacDataGenerator to parse gps almanac files, creates comparison data and generates subframes for testing     - Other subframes necessary are generated by hand, see comments in EngAlmanac_T     - Debugging getUTC method, returns certain values out of range
      Corrected binary sv id for subframe 4 page 25 which prevented the page from being stored
      Refactored the get method tests
      Finishing EngAlmanac_T     - Conversion of WNlsf from the binary subframe to an integer value is     incorrect due to an error in EngNav's convertXbit method. This method     implicitly signs the values passed to it, causing an error for unsigned values     - Conversion of DN from bthe binary subframe to an integer value is     incorrect. The IS-GPS-200D states that the DN value is subframe 4 page 18     is right justified, but the gpstk treats it as left-justified     - Resolved error in EngAlmanac_T UTC parameters     - Closes 95

      Generated all the data necessary to construct the ORDS, but need new data files
      Successfully generated ObsRngDev objects, completed basic test     - RinexNavData time system set to GPS by default, bad. How else can time system be set?
      Successfully created one IonoModel object using EngAlmanac, but too much overhead. Rewriting to generate IonoModelStore entirely by hand
      Factoring tests into fail counters, 91 tests count as one     - Added basic initialization tests for single frequency constructors     - Completed get function testing
      Decided to remove the RinexObs dependencies and generate Ords by hand     Ran into invalid time system issues, can't find where the error is, so making test much simpler     Committing to backup the existing test before the purge of RinexObs

      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk     - Resolved Conflict in core/tests/FileHandling/CMakeLists.txt     - Removed all instances of "^M" that some windows user slopped into the file.     - Please use dos2unix or manually remove all instances of "^M" before future commits.     - Linux/Unix uses 0xA for a newline character. Windows uses a combination of two characters: 0xD 0xA. 0xD is the carriage return character. Most editors will display 0xD as "^M" and any file diffs on Linux will show them too.
      Updates to build_config.h.in to add C++ style methods for paths.

      Updated build framework, including addition of install prefix input and handling.
      Building, bug fixes and updates for path and log file handling in build.sh, including:     - Removed initialization of build_root, and added initialization of system and use specific build roots.     - Added logic so that the system_build_root is the default, but user_build_root is used if -u flag is used.     - Removed build_root assignment syntax from help function usage()     - Added string formatting to echoed config values     - Added more detailed treatment of build and install paths, testing for their existence, trying to create them if not present, and exiting the process entirely if they cannot be created.     - Added the use of the tee command to calls to cmake, make, make install, and ctest so that all stdout and stderr are both sent to the screen and to new log files, which are saved to the build_root path.
      Minor changes to variable names in build.sh for clairty.

      Test Framework, Updates to TestUtil class     - added verbosity data member, with default 1     - added method setTestLine() that can accept an int or string     - modified constructor so as to strip off path from input test file name, e.g., __FILE__ returns a full path, but we don't need it     - added failMessage data member, which is reset to an empty string by next()     - added a setFailMessage() method     - overloaded setFailMessage() so that it can optionaly take a line number as a second input parameter, as either a string or an int, e.g. __LINE__     - overloaded fail() method so that it can optionally take a failMessage string and a line number, e.g. __LINE__     - overloaded failTest() method so that it can optionally take a failMessage string and a line number, e.g. __LINE__     - modified print() method to print "key=value" pairs instead of just values     - modified print() method to test for failBit and verbosity and to optionally print failMessage key=value pair     - added getTolerance() method     - changed log keyword from "TestOutput" to "GpstkTest"     - updated build.sh script to accomodate changes to test output log file
      Testing, modified RinexMet_T.cpp to demonstrate use of newly updated TestUtil class.
      Test Framework, TestUtil, fixed default values for failMessage.
      Build script, added flags to control python binding process. Default off.     - modified build.sh, changing -p flag to set build_python=True     - modified build.sh, adding -P flag to accept input python executable path     - modified build.sh, wrapping all relevant blocks with test for build_python=1     - modified build.sh, passing "-DBUILD_PYTHON=ON" to cmake     - modified CMakeLists.txt, adding an optional switch BUILD_PYTHON, default OFF     - modified CMakelists.txt, wrapping the add_subdirectory(swig) with a test for BUILD_PYTHON

      Build and Test, updated build.sh to compute percent passed for test categories.
      Build, minor updates to test log parsing, additional test keywords counted.
      Testing, overhaul to TestUtil class, rewritten CommonTime_T to demonstrate use.     - The design of TestUtil was found to be internally inconsistent and confusing     - The methods were trying to follow two different approaches:       (1) small simple methods, forcing many calls per test case       (2) large methods wrapping small methods, allowing fewer calls per test case     - The problem was all were public methods, and the two design approaches were       not independent or complete, so you had to use a mixture of both.     - Decision was made to make the interface almost entirely based on a new assert()       which wraps and calls all needed smaller methods, and to change all the smaller       wrapped methods from public to private, and deleting other methods that tried       to be both large and small, represented the worst of the mixed design.     - TestUtil, assert() updated to take failMessage and lineNumber, and call next()     - TestUtil, methods deprecated/removed include the following:       init(), passTest(), failTest(), assert(bool, string="none")     - TestUtil, methods changed from public to private:       print(), pass(), fail(), next(), undo()     - Complete rewrite of CommonTime_T.cpp to both use the new TestUtil as       the new design intends, and to demonstrate preferred code style for test apps,       including use of white-space and comment block delimiters. All test descriptions       were moved to the failMessage inputs to assert() but can still be searched.
      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
      Testing, updates to TestUtil.assert() to finish off this overhaul     - removed assert(bool) signature so as to force test developers       to always give a message and line number, e.g. using __LINE__       to prevent assert(true) from givin n context and having the wrong file line     - changed provate data member failMessage to testMessage     - changed public method setFailMessage() to setTestMessage()     - changed assert() method, adding calls to setTestMessage()       and setTestLine() not just for cases where fail() is called     - Deleted comment blocks fo old deprecated methods     - updated CommonTime_T.cpp calls to assert(true) so they are       passed a testmessage and __LINE__     - updated conventions of test formatting used as test_message       passed to assert() calls to demonstrate a possible convention.
      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
      Testing, updated to Rinex_T to use new TestUtil.assert() interface.     - refactored assert message strings     - added __LINE__ input for all assert calls     - added test description string input for all assert calls     - replaced all pass(), fail(), passTest(), failTest() calls with assert() calls.
      Testing, updated to RinexNav_T to use new TestUtil.assert() interface.     - refactored assert message strings     - added __LINE__ input for all assert calls     - added test description string input for all assert calls     - replaced all pass(), fail(), passTest(), failTest() calls with assert() calls.     - removed all calls to next()     - fixed indentation and try/catch blocks
      Testing, updated to RinexObs_T to use new TestUtil.assert() interface.     - refactored assert message strings     - added __LINE__ input for all assert calls     - added test description string input for all assert calls     - replaced all pass(), fail(), passTest(), failTest() calls with assert() calls.     - removed all calls to next()     - fixed indentation and try/catch blocks
      Build, reordered add_subdirectory() directives so that the stuff that breaks is lower on the list, allowing the stuff that builds to be built and not skipped.
      Testing, bug fixes to RinexNav_T
      Testing, updates to RinexMet_T to use new TestUtil.assert() interface.
      Build and Test, Updates to CmakeLists.txt files     - commented out CMake add_test() for broken test apps unilt they can be fixed     - changed order of some CMake add tests to push broken stuff to bottom     - added category for BinUtils to build.sh to report test results
      Build script, replaced all command substitution backticks/graves with the more modern POSIX form, so value=`foo` changes to value=$(foo)

      Build, simplify CMakeLists.txt to reduce scatter of /ext and /core conditionals
      Python bindings, addition of PythonSetup.cmake for manual configuration.
      Python bindings, fixes to CMake cache types for python config template.
      Testing, cleaning old ext test files
      Testing, removal of an old copy of a header that also lives in the core lib.     - test apps shall test only the current version of the headers     - test apps shall not test headers in the source tree, but only in the install tree     - this version of StringUtils.hpp is an old copy of the one in core/lib     - it had apparently been copied into the path with/for the test app that needed it.     - the effect was that the test was testing an old version of the class, not the current version     - as such, the test was made worse than simply dead code, it was misleading.     - code difference as compared to the current version is the removal of method x2int()     - x2int() was in the past replaced by x2uint() which does not strip off the "0x" part of HEX strings.

L * U doesn't = A     	- Housefolder decomp fails in one instance where entire column returned is incorrect     	- SVD function tested by verifying U * S * V^T = A, but the matrix returned is nonequivalent due to column negation and other errors

Minor spelling fix in EngEphemeris_T     - fixParity function in EngNav fails, fixParity calls computeParity but doesn't pass     the knownUpright bool. See issue 147     - EngEphemeris test differs slightly from the TestUtil standard. Many of the EngEphemeris     functions store ephemeris data in different ways. To test this, a set of tests are put in     a function and are called to verify the storage method.     - Data for these tests was reconstructed from the RINEX Nav file     data/test_input_rinex_nav_FilterTest2.99n     - Minor spelling fix in EngEphemeris.hpp     - closes #96, closes #97

      Changes to the TimeHandling tests so that they now match the new test class naming scheme (from xCLASS to CLASS_T) and adding the additional tests to ANSITime_T. Also a new test method has been added to CivilTime_T. Finally, the testFramework.hpp file is being removed in favor of TestUtil.hpp.
      Update for TestUtil.hpp to include the three extra methods to change a string in the output and the passTest and failTest methods. ANSITime_T.cpp has been updated to reflect these changes.
      Updated core/lib/GNSSEph/RinexEphemerisStore.cpp so that the loadFile method will open the file before reading from it. Updated TestUtil.hpp so that passTest() and failTest() will increment the test counter properly. Updated CivilTime_T.cpp so to remove a couple of redundant tests.
      I broke the build. It is now fixed. RinexEphemerisStore::loadFile will no longer use the is_open method derived from the (great-grand)parent fstream class. The new method is to use a simple !RinexNavStream_Object to denote whether the file has been opened.
      Adding minor comment changes to ANSITime_T and CivilTime_T. Also adding a completed RinexEphemerisStore_T. This new test has many failures associated with it. These failures are documented on GPSTk-MSNTk merger Test Bug list. Also some small functionality has been removed from GPSEphemeris in that the dumpHeader method will no longer rely on the SVNumXRef class in ext.
      Commit to clean up a number of small issues:       1) core/tests/CMakeLists.txt now only includes directories where GPSTk tests have been written. Be sure to update this list as you move to the skipped directories.       2) core/tests/Math/Vector_T.cpp did not compile. This has been fixed.       3) core/tests/TimeHandling/CivilTime_T.cpp and core/tests/TimeHandling/YDSTime_T.cpp have been updated to fail as per the bug page.
      Forgot to cleanup the GNSSEph directory and remove some comments as the test was being built. Also removing IonoModel_T so that the tests will build on non cppunit machines when cloned.
      Commit changes the following:
      Commit to add the SP3EphemerisStore_T.cpp test. Removed all stored output and comparison files associated with this test as they are no longer necessary.
      Pulling changes which include the addition of Sinex.
      Adding core/tests/Utilities/StringUtils_T.cpp tests.
      When trying to build with the SunSolaris compiler, there are issues.     These issues stem from the use of __func__ which CC does not recognize.     The changes are:
      Commit for test result filtering and new additions:     1) All test result output which contained additional commas have been revised.     2) RinexEphemerisStore_T test results now correctly reflect which of the parent        classes to RinexEphemerisStore is actually under test.     3) Added TimeRange.hpp and TimeRange.cpp from MSNTk to core/lib/TimeHandling     4) Added an unfinished test for TimeRange to core/tests/TimeHandling

      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
      Updates to correct some errors in building using the SunSolaris compilers.     1)core/lib/Math/Stats.hpp now uses sqrt( (long double) ) castings to get the highest accuracy.       Note that the sqrt result is then cast back to whatever type the template is using.     2) core/lib/Utilities/ValidType.hpp now defaults the value variable to zero when using the default constructor.     3) core/tests/TimeHandling/UnixTime_T.cpp was not running its initialization test.     4) core/tests/Math/Triple_T.cpp now uses proper floating point comparisons in assertions.
      RinexEphemerisStore_T.cpp has been updated to use the newest file path conventions. Also the files related to this test have been moved to the data directory.
      SP3EphemerisStore_T.cpp has been updated to the new file path conventions. Its inputs have been moved to the data directory.
      Edits to the files Joseph added. Mainly comments. Also deleted unused files in core/tests/Math/ which were remnants of CPPUNIT.
      Adding the test for SystemTime.
      Investigated why WxObsMap_T.cpp fails on the SunSolaris compiler.     Found that the failing comparisons were comparing two single precision floating     point values by using the absolute value of their difference and enforcing that     this difference be less than a tolerance. That tolerance was set to 1E-12, a     value appropriate only for double precision. This tolerance was changed to 1E-7.
      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
      Updating StringUtils_T so that it will work on all platforms
      I have been corrected.     The hexDataDump test has been split into two separate     methods. hexDataDumpTest will now test only for     formatting of the output. This means that any characters,     like end-of-file or end-of-line, which are not common     across all platforms will be replaced by alphanumeric ones.     The second test, hexToAsciiTest, will leave those characters     in to ensure that they are handled properly. This test will     need a revision so that an independent method (not using gpstk)     of converting those hex values to ASCII is used for the comparison     checks.
      Use of captain showed a bug in Triple_T.cpp and Triple.cpp.     In the azimuth angle test you cannot get an azimuth angle if you     are referencing a vector the is parallel to the direction of the origin.     There is a built in test in Triple.cpp to check for this but the tolerance     on it was set to 1E-16 which is too small, especially when adding two     numbers which are on the order of computational round off error. This     tolerance has been raised to match the other test in the azAngle method     (This check to check is to ensure the observer position is NOT along     the z axis.).
      Adding additional files to core/lib/GNSSCore from ext:     1) geometry.hpp - constants file which is needed by Triple, EphemerisRange, and HelmertTransform.     2) gps_constants.hpp - Needed by core/ClockModel and core/GNSSEph files.     3) compass_constants.hpp - Moving prior to merge with GNSSconstants.hpp
      Moving files to end Rinex 3 dependencies on ext:     1) *Ephemeris.hpp (or .cpp) - These files will are used in Rinex 3     2) PZ90Ellipsoid.hpp - Needed by GloEphemeris.hpp     3) SVNumXRef.hpp - Needed by BDSEphemeris.cpp, EngEphemeris.cpp, and GPSEphemeris.cpp
      3rd set of file moves from ext to core:     1) BrcKeplerOrbit.hpp and BrcClockCorrection.hpp - needed by EngEphemeris.hpp     2) ClockSatStore.hpp and PositionSatStore.hpp - needed by SP3EphemerisStore.hpp     3) TabularSatStore.hpp - needed by ClockSatStore.hpp and PositionSatStore.hpp     4) Xv.hpp - Needed by the BrcKeplerOrbit.hpp
      Final set of moves for ending core's dependency on ext     Moved the remainder of the Utilities in ext to core. CommandLine.cpp depends on     a couple of these files, but after speaking with Bryan a decision was made to     move all the Utilities from ext to core.

      CMakeLists.txt: include GNUInstallDirs module for standard directory definitions.
      swig/CMakeLists.txt: PYTHON_INSTALL_PREFIX properly defaults to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
      Unified definition of version (major, minor, patch) variables.
      Generate package import cmake file for use by other cmake projects.
      Correct CMakeLists.txt so it tries to remove getopt.h from the correct list.

Steve Johnson (5):
      Add StringUtils::splitOnWhitespace(...) method and tests
      Add a few more splitOnWhitespace tests
      Clean up debug output.  Add empty string test cases to StringUtils::splitOnWhitespace

      Actually took out the line that were just commented out in the previous modification.
      huh?
      Hacked out the code which writes the log file. This will need to be handeled more elegantly but it does provide a 20x speed up.

renfrob (5):
      Adding split field unpacking to PackedNavBits
      Generalized PackedNavBits.matchBits()
      Tweaking BDS track codes

	Jason Vestuto (49):
	      Build framework bug fixes: Corrected instances of sgltk to gpstk in CMake input file, and added creation of build directory for the python bindings.
	      Restoring a header file that is required SGL toolkits dependent upon GPSTk. May need to migrate this header to the other toolkit.
	      Disambiguation of multiple headers with the same file name by removal of one and updating comments of the other.
	      Removal of mistakenly restored header that has been migrated to SGLTk.
	      Added a missing mkdir for the python install directory.
	      Overhaul of python bindings build and install using CMake.      
	      	- Overhaul of both CMake files and build script to build python bindings by linking to libgpstk.so rather than recompiling GPSTK C++ library source files.      
	      	- Updated both the CMake files and build script to not export environment variables, while still allowing user-defined environment to be used to set the install path.      
	      	- Added a test of $PATH and $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, such that the user is warned if neither contain the gpstk install path.      
	      	- Added a CMake Find module to allow CMake process for the python module build to find the GPSTK install rather than hard-coding relative files paths.      
	      	- Modified the python module CMakeLists.txt, replacing the gpstk source file list with a find directive, and adding install directives to place _gpstk.os and gpstk.py in site-packages.      
	      	- Updated the build script to follow the new pattern of having the bindings link against a pre-built libgpstk.so rather than recompiling *.cpp files in the GPSTK library.
	      Removal of duplicate header file entries in gpstk_swig.hpp.
	      Several bug fixes for the default GPSTk install path handling.      
	      	- Fixed a typo in the build script which misnamed gpstk_install path variable name, causing the default to be ignored.      
	      	- Fixed a logic error in the CMake Find module so that the python bindings properly accept the default gpstk install path.      
	      	- Added the default gpstk_install path in the cmake call for the python bindings, so that an environment variable does not need to be set for the python module to build.
	      Changed default install path for the python extension module.      
	      	- Previous path was a /gpstk sub-directory under ~/.local/lib/<python-version>/site-packages      
	      	- sys.path does not know about sub-directories under site-packages, so removed the trailing /gpstk and just install to site-packages directly.
	      Updated CMake find directive for PythonLibs to force python2 vs python3.
	      Changed the python extension module install back to using a gpstk subdirectory. Have added the required module __init__.py file that was missing from the last revision.
	      Updates to both test and example scripts to account for namespace changes in the python extension module.      
	      	- Fixed references attributes under gpstk.constants, gpstk.exceptions, gpstk.cpp      
	      	- Fixed import statements referencing same.      
	      	- Improved usage and example usage statements in docstrings of example scripts
	      Updated SWIG interface file by adding an %extend directive to add the __getitem__() method to gpstk::Triple so that it could support indexing as seen in the python extension module. This fixes about a dozen otherwise broken test cases in test.py.
	      Updated the SWIG interface file to remove all the "_swigregister" pollution seen in the gpstk python extension module namespace.
	      Updated SWIG interface file, adding a missing include of the Triple.i secondary SWIG input file. Parts of a previous fix, needed because of that missing include, were moved from gpstk.i to Triple.i.
	      Initial commit of a distribution install package for the python extension module using distutils. Needs further testing.
	      Restructuring python package file tree for distutils installs.     
	      	- Moved /data and /test directories into /gpstk package dir and added init files     
	      	- Added methods to gpstk.data init file, including full_path() to get file paths and load_data() load data files as byte strings attributes.     
	      	- Added method to gpstk.test, run_all(), to allow all test cases to be run from within python.     
	      	- Updated test cases that require input data file reads to call gpstk.data.full_path() method to determine data file path after install.     
	      	- Updated setup.py for distutils to treat /data and /test and sub-packages     
	      	- Updated setup.py for distutils to correctly associate files _gpstk.so and gpstk.py with the gpstk package at install time.     
	      	- Updated both the MANIFEST.in and README.txt to reflect package file tree changes.
	      Updated python extension package example to use gpstk.data method to determine full file path of data file after install.
	      Update to build script to account for changes in python package install using distutils. Addition of optional methods in CMake files to be further developed so that one can build and install with CMake, or just build with CMake and install with distutils outside of CMake, both in a consistent way.
	      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
	      Updated python package CMake install options.     
	      	- Removed optional install methods that were used for previous tests.     
	      	- Preserved two CMake options: (1) to build and (2) to build and install
	      Python bindings, CMake install options clean up:     
	      	- added hooks to script_gpstk.sh to trigger sphinx documentation generation.     
	      	- cleaned up CMake/distutils install options so that either CMake does it or the user has to call "python setup.py install" manually.     
	      	- updated the --prefix flag in CMake since "~/.local" and CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIXare not treated in the same way nor generate the results on install.     
	      	- Refactored test of users PYTHON install in CMake files.
	      Python bindings, update to distutils setup files, package init, and CHANGES file.     
	      	- moved setup.py.in to the same pat as the CMakeLists.txt file     
	      	- Removed all references to distutils.Extension since the wrapper code is compiled with CMake, not distutils.     
	      	- Left the setup.py in the install_package path, even though it is overwritten every time you use the CMake install option. If not delivered with the package, other install and package options would not be available without a cmake install, even though cmake is not required after the build.     
	      	- removed unused and broken load_data() method from gpstk.data __init__.py file     
	      	- added comment to previously empty CHANGES.txt
	      Python bindings, deleted unused __init__.py file in the swig directory.
	      Python bindings, clean up of file tree.     
	      	- moving but preserving some data files for fic and msc     
	      	- removing duplicate copies of example and test files found outside of the install package.
	      Python bindings, updates to unit tests in gpstk.test     
	      	- corrected the expected output of the gpstk.scanTime() test for the ( '158 200', '%F %g') case     
	      	- added a new unit test for gpstk.CivilTime for date '01 06 1980'
	      Python bindings, fixed namespace bug by changing gpstk.exceptions to gpstk
	      Python bindings, clean up of some includes in the context of trying to determine why SWIG wraps and presents some implicit conversion/constructor operators for various ephemeris objects from C++ and not others.
	      Python bindings, updates to install package meta-data files.
	      Python bindings, removal of user-specific name in example file paths.
	      Python bindings, updated test package so that individual test modules can be run as scripts or from the python interpreter as e.g. gpstk.test.run_util()
	      Python bindings, removal of files no longer used.
	      Python bindings, addition of scripts used to test python package installs. For use by devlopers, not for distribution.
	      Python bindings, updated script_gpstk to create a ZIP file of the html documentation output from Sphinx and place it in the install_package/docs directory for package distribution.
	      Python bindings, correction of RINEX data file names.     
	      	- Testing revealed the data files rinex3obs_data.txt and rinex3nav_data.txt to be RINEX2 format.     
	      	- Corrected file names and all references to them in the test and data modules.
	      Python bindings, grooming of package meta-data files, including additional markdown formatting.
	      Python bindings, updtes to Sphinx RST documentation files to account for recent changes to the python bindings build and install package.
	      Python bindings, corrections to RST formatting in Sphinx documentation.
	      Updated top-level project README for clarity, including a table of contents, more explicit references to other documentation files within the source file tree, and references to the python bindings package.
	      Python bindings, removal of unused scripts, and addition of draft code block for creating source distribution packages for the python package in script_gpstk.sh
	      Python bindings, removal of unused scripts, and addition of draft code block for creating source distribution packages for the python package in script_gpstk.sh
	      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
	      GPSTk documentation, updates to README and addition of full GPL/LGPL licensing files needed. LGPL depends on the GPL, so we need to distribute copies of both with the source code.
	      GPSTk build script, minor updates to white-space formatting.
	      GPSTk build script, updated script header comments.
	      GPSTk Licensing, pleased copies of the full GPL and LGPL amendments in the gpstk/dev directory to ensure that the any portion of the file tree that we might distribute include the full license documents. In the future, we may have the package install scripts simply copy the top-level documents.
	      GPSTk install, moving dev/INSTALL to dev/INSTALL.txt to avoid conflicts with things that are not case-sensitive when you try to create an dev/install/ subdirectory
	      GPSTk project documentation, changing all top-level documentation file names to be consistent with the pattern FILENAME.txt

	      Merge branch 'master' of repositories.arlut.utexas.edu:sgl/gpstk
	      Refactor of script_gpstk.sh to work with current paths correctly along with pruning of some diagnostics. Python build now uses the source tree and not the install tree
	      python gpstk module install is now done from cmake/make with reasonable defaults
	      Now honors the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX definition if the gpstk environment variable isn't defined
	      Examples now use the proper rinex 3 obs identitiers.

Version 2.1   Tuesday, June 25, 2013

   General modifications
   ---------------------
   - Version 2.1 is comprised of SVN revision number 3143 to Git revision number 4daf3c5 
   - A number of modifications were made to Jamfiles, Makefiles, and source code 
     for clean compilation (no warnings or errors) & compatibility with the latest 
	 Cygwin, Windows 7 VS, Solaris 10 Sparc, and Mac OX X Lion (10.7.5).
   - Base CMake files have been added for future CMake support, still in development
     stages.
   - The next planned release, GPSTk v2.2, will be a minor upgrade that will introduce
     a new fully functioning CMake cross-platform build system and deprecation of some
     older supported platforms.	 
   - This release includes new/modified source code comments for improved
     readability.

   - Deleted from src

       TabularEphemerisStore.cpp
         This class now obsoleted; functions reimplemented in new Ephemeris 
	 Store classes (SP3).

       ECEF.[h|c]pp
       Geodetic.[h|c]pp
	  Removed ECEF and Geodetic (which are deprecated), and 
	  modified code to use Position instead.

       EngEphemeris.cpp
	  Added modifications (Mendiola).

   - Added to lib

       /geomatics/AntennaStore.hpp
       /geomatics/KalmanFilter.hpp

       /geomatics/singleton.hpp
          Added new files to lib/geomatics from Rinex-3 branch.

       /procframe/ConstraintSystem.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/Variable.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'ConstraintSystem' class to RC2.0, as well as the appropriate
	  changes in 'Variable' class.

       /procframe/GeneralEquations.[h|c]pp
	  Added class 'GeneralEquations' to RC2.0.  The original 
	  version had very long inline methods, which are not recommended; 
	  therefore, a 'GeneralEquations.cpp' file was added.

       /procframe/Differentiator.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'Differentiator' class to RC2.0.

       /procframe/EquationSystem.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/GeneralConstraint.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/SolverGeneral.[h|c]pp
	  Added 'GeneralConstraint' class, as well as additions to related 
	  classes.

       /rxio/EphReader.cpp
       /rxio/FFIdentifier.cpp
       /rxio/MDPPVTSolution.hpp
	  Modified library to reflect more meaningful constants' names in 
	  XvtStore.

       /procframe/DataHeaders.[h|c]pp
       /procframe/DataStructures.[h|c]pp
	  Changed to CommonTime.

       /procframe/ProcessingClass.hpp
          The 'getIndex()' method and its associated operators were deleted 
	  from 'ProcessingClass'. This feature made developing more complex, 
	  it potentially limited the compilation on parallel machines, and 
	  it seems that no one was using it.

          position string with leading spaces to a Position.  SourceForge Bug
          ID #1530502.

       StringUtils.hpp
          Fixed namespace issue: strtod, strtoul, strtol declared in cstdlib
          but this was not included in StringUtils causing an error on some
          platforms. Also fixed formatting issue. Also modified to eliminate
          definition conflict with Windows "max" function.

       TypeID.[h|c]pp
          New types added to handle common derivatives. Also added derivatives
          for phase observations and some combinations; added corresponding
          TypeID's for the GRoup And PHase Ionospheric Combinations (GRAPHIC).
          Also new TypeIDs added w/ability to manage new TypeIDs w/string name.
          Added extra qualification on member class and std space for 'pair'
          to fix compilation errors. Also added a new TypeID 'codeBias' used to
          estimate slant TEC and separate interfrequency bias. Also added new
          "wide lane" TypeIDs for use in fast ambiguity resolution, as well as 
          'WL2' and related combinations. TypeIDs added to support 'spaceborne'
          data processing. TypeIDs added for GPS precise code observation 
          derivative.

       PRSolution.cpp
          Fixed RAIM algorithm to continue when it fails to converge if there's
          still room to do combinations (i.e., still possible to reject
          satellites). Also modified to save the covariance matrix
          corresponding to the best solution.

       SVNumXRef.cpp
          Updated class for launch of SVN50/PRN05 on 8/17/09. Also updated for

          surface plots of its solutions. Paper is in the works. Also, mpsolve
          user can edit out days when processing large directories of data.
          Also added zero mean assumption to add final de-bias/constraint on
          DFM processing. Disabled position solution consistency check. Also in
          mpsolve fixed two bugs: one for the DFM method when no intersections

Version 1.4   Tuesday, December 18, 2007

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Majority of version 1.4 comprised of revision number 863 
	  branching took place under revision 864 from dev/ to RC1.4/
	
	- Major refactoring of the Ephemeris/Almanac classes. This change may 
	  break some apps. To fix them the following translations are useful:
	
              Old                           |        New
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    gpstk::EphemerisStore		    | gpstk::XvtStore<gpstk::SatID>
    gpstk::BCEphemerisStore		    | gpstk::GPSEphemerisStore
    gpstk::AlmanacStore                     | gpstk::GPSAlmanacStore
    gpstk::EphemerisStore::NoEphemerisFound | gpstk::InvalidRequest
    eph.getSatXvt(sat, time)	            | eph.getXvt(sat, time)
    eph.getSatXvt(prn, time)		    | eph.getXvt(SatID(prn, SatID::systemGPS), time)
    eph.dump(0, cout)			    | eph.dump(cout, 0)


        - Added an updated LaTeX source for table describing apps of v1.3, 
	        as well as a list of classes in the gpstk libraries 
	        (sorted & categorized) found in ref/glance/

	- Added LeTex source for the GPSTk paper at the ION-GNSS-2006

	- Added a library /dev/lib/vplot/ to create drawing primitives in SVG 
	        and postscript formats. Intended to support complex, fully 
	        customizable visualizations on GNSS analyses. Supported only 
	        in jam for now,	but with the hope of support in make.

	- Improved version control 
	  * set gpstk package version to 1.3 in the autoconf build world
	  * set the current shared library major version to 13, so gpstk 1.3
	    delivers lib{gpstk,rxio,mdplib,...}.so.13.0
	  * now allows jam and make to build shared libraries with the 
	    appropriate versions
	  * causes jam to install headers to $PREFIX/include/gpstk to prevent 
	    header namespace collision. This behaviour is consistent with the 
	    "make" build.

Version 1.1   Friday, January 7, 2005

	General modifications
	---------------------

	- Added patches to support more compilers:
	     GNU compiler version 3.4
	     GNU compiler under AIX
	     Sun ONE Studio 8

	- GNU make/configure capabilities have been added. Since this
	  is a new feature, your mileage may vary. The makefiles
	  work on systems with newer autoconf toolchain versions.

	- More examples were added to gpstk/examples.
	  These examples are described in the website.

	- Major revamp of the website.
	
	Library modifications
	---------------------

	- P code generator was allocating over 20 megabytes in
	  processes that use the shared library. Now the 20 megabytes
	  are not allocated until the P code generator is initialized
	  by the user.
	
	- Bug fix: FileSpec::extractDayTime() now initializes
	  DayTimes generated from file name to have zero hours,
	  zero minutes, zero seconds, etc.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS now more robust when accepting
	  a year number as a hint to disambiguate which full GPS
	  week to use.
	
	- Added more DayTime tests.
	
	- Bug fix: DayTime user-defined tolerance for comparisons now is
	  working.

	- Bug fix: DayTime::setGPS(short week, long zcount, short year)
	  now works across a year rollover.
	
	- Renamed WxObsData::find(...) to getWxObservation(...) to remove
	  any confusion that might develop over having the same method
	  name as the STL.
	
	- Bug fix: satellite combinations in RAIM sometimes incorrect when 
	  a user-marked satellite was present.

	- Some Vector routines were throwing Exception instead of 
	  VectorException.

	- Added Vector-Matrix concatentation operators.

	- Added a sub-Vector constructor.

	- Modification to Householder decomposition routine.
	
	- Various fixes to MatrixOperators.

	- Updates to FIC routines.

	- Implemented azimuth and elevation functions in Position, making 
	  use of the functions inherited from Triple. Modified EphemerisRange
	  to use Position, as well as TropModel and ResCor; this eliminated 
	  a bug in the azimuth() in EphemerisRange and means that now there 
	  is only one implementation of az and el. Added a test of the new 
	  routines in positiontest. Also added a Position constructor from Xvt.

	- Bugs in DayTime::setToString() - %f was missing (!) and %S 
	  was acting as %f should; date was trashed when time was set, 
	  and vice versa, and year input was not properly handled.

	- Implemented ionospheric model types other than linear.

	- Cleaned up weather data handling (e.g., error checks).

	
	Application modifications
	-------------------------
	
	apps/difftools

	- Unified code using a common class.


	apps/filetools

	- Improvments to navdmp.

	- New utility called rinexthin for subsampling RINEX observation
	  files.

	
	apps/binding
	
	- This  new project provides GPSTk bindings in other languages
	  has been added. This capability is in an alpha state.
	  Currently there are a limited set of bindings for
	  Tcl/Tk, Python and Octave.

	
	apps/RinexEditor

	-  Bug fix: 'delete all' command was being deleted prematurely.
