      /** FileHunter is a class designed to find files matching specified
       * criteria.  The specified criteria is threefold:
       * 1.  The File Specification.  This is a path and/or file description
       *  which is the most important search criteria.  For instance, the
       *  specification for a Rinex Obs file might be:
       *    /archive/ADMS%3n/RINEXOBS/S%2n%t%3jA.%2y0
       *  where the '%#char' elements denote fields such as year, day, station
       *  number, and so on.  In this example, FileHunter is smart enough to
       *  search all station directories (ADMS401, ADMS402, etc) but it won't
       *  search any directories (or subdirectories) other than ones that
       *  match the initial specification.
       * 2. Start and end times.  If you simply call find(), FileHunter will
       *  return all files that match the specification.  You can specify
       *  CommonTimes to only return files whose dates (according to the file
       *  name) fall between those times.  Note that you can tell find() to
       *  return the list of files ascending, descending, or unsorted
       *  (unsorted will return them in disk order).
       * 3. Filters.  Filters can be used on any field that your file
       *  specification includes.  The most appropriate use of this is to
       *  filter for a certain set of stations, but it will allow you to
       *  filter ANY field (day, year, etc) that is in the file specification.
       *  
       * For more information about file specifications, see the comments in
       * the FileSpec class.  Also check the file FileSpecTest in the test
       * subdirectory below this one for examples.
       *
       * Limitations:  If a file specification has two or more of the same
       * field defined, only the first one is used.  This is only if they
       * repeat in a single directory or path.  For instance, this would be ok:
       * /ADMS%3n/FILE%3n but in this case: /ADMS%3n/%3j%3j  only the first
       * %3j would be used for the day field.
       * Also, wildcards cannot be used.  Sorry - it's a limitation of how
       * regular expressions are used.
       * Finally, if you specify a version field, all files matching
       * will be returned.  You can either use extractField() on the
       * returned files to determine the latest version or select the
       * version you want returned by using setFilter().
