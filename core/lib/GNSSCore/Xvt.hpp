          * \li Uninitialized - This is used to indicate that the
          *     health status has never been properly set.  This
          *     generally indicates a coding error in the library.
          * \li Unavailable - This is used to indicate that orbit (or
          *     health, in the case of getSVHealth calls) information
          *     is not available for the satellite at the time of
          *     interest.
          * \li Unused - This indicates that the XvtStore class or
          *     other class generating this Xvt or health status does
          *     not actually contain or provide health information.
          *     An example of this is the SP3EphemerisStore.
          * \li Unknown - This is used to indicate that the store was
          *     able to provide a PVT, but for whatever reason was not
          *     able to determine the health state of the satellite.
          * \li Unhealthy - This indicates that the satellite is known
          *     to be in an unhealthy state at the time of interest.
          * \li Degraded - This indicates that the satellite is known
          *     to be in a degraded state at the time of interest
          *     (currently only Galileo supports such a state).
          * \li Healthy - This indicates that the satellite is known
          *     to be in a healthy state.
