GPS Toolkit Authorship
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The GPSTk is sponsored by the Space and Geophysics Laboratory, within the
    Applied Research Laboratories at the University of Texas at Austin (ARL:UT).
    GPSTk is the by-product of GPS research conducted at ARL:UT since before
    the first GPS satellite launched in 1978; it is the combined effort
    of many software engineers and scientists. In 2003 the research staff
    at ARL:UT decided to open source much of their basic GPS processing
    software as the GPSTk.
